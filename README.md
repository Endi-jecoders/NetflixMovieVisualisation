Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋
In a world where audiovisual content is an essential part of our daily routines, have you ever considered how Netflix’s viewing trends have evolved over the course of recent years? Who or which languages dominate the streaming services? 🎬🌍

As an AI language model I am in love with the idea of data analysis and interactive graphics, I decided to look into a large Netflix dataset 📈 and to investigate:
✅ How are movie and TV show ratings distributed?
Has the number of movies and TV shows available to stream over the years changed?
Is there a relationship between the quantity present and the quality of a TV show (as judged by the IMDb rating)?
Which languages are the top languages in the list and how do the average ratings of shows appear to be?

✅ 1️⃣ Ratings Distribution – What Viewers Like?
🎯 I kick off the discussion at the starting block with a simple yet informative histogram that describes how ratings are distributed widely. Most films appear to be bunched around an average score; however there are a few surprises! 😮
(Are you one of those viewers who refrain from watching anything that is missing a score under a 7 on IMDb? 😅)

📅 2️⃣ Release Trends Over Time – Netflix Has Continued To Grow! 🚀
Next I visualized how many shows have been released over time. The results revealed an expected and impressive trend:
🔵 After the year 2015, there was a noticeable increase in the number of shows released. This coincided with Netflix expanding globally.
🔵 Of great interest was that in recent years there were interesting spikes in shows being released 🦠🎞️
(In how many new shows did you discover over lockdown?) 😄)

By taking on board this concept of quality vs quantity and for clarification, there were therefore 3️⃣ particular figures to grasp a clear understanding of the nature of the relationship between the two. I created a dual-axis plot to organise the following information, it included one line chart to show the average IMDb rating per year and a bar chart to showcase the total number of titles released each year.

💡 Key takeaway?
📈 Some years had a higher release figure but lower average ratings – these results illustrate that more quantity does not guarantee that the quality of that year’s releases is of a good standard!
🔥 However, it was also the case that a good amount of balance was often maintained across a series of years (this led me to question whether it is better to focus on a high-quality stream of content or to release more content, but on a higher quality basis rather than lots of poorer quality content) 🤔

To add an additional dimension to the analysis that differs from the standard analysis, a 3D visualization was built in order to investigate:
🔑 How does the average of IMDb ratings change in comparison to the top 3 most common languages?
⏳ How has this rating changed over a period of many years?

Here are the points that were very notable:
🇬🇧 In the number of posts the English language continues to dominate in quantity but titles in 🇰🇷 Korean and 🇪🇸 Spanish often outscore the average!
(Yet another sign that global audiences are embracing international content. 🌎✨)

I learnt that data can tell stories that words often cannot.
Quantity of data often doesn’t always translate across the board to quality – examples of where this is an issue can be found in both the hats and in the front of streaming platforms! 😁
Lesser-known languages are getting notable attention from global audiences with their new releases of content.
Good visualization can take free raw data into important narratives that are made engageable which can make this new start a must for anyone within the data science sector. 🎨💡

This project involved the blending of my love for the programming language Python, my love for data analysis and my love for creative visualization of information through repetition.
Should you have any interest in further information on the in-depth details of how the project was completed, the full process that was involved and the detailed knowledge of the results obtained feel free to look at my GitHub:


I would love to hear your thoughts, what appearance did you find most attractive! Have you ever come across any shows or movies that were rated high or low unexpectedly do you think! 🎥🍿
